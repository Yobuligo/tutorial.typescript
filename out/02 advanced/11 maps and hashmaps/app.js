// there a certain ways to create a maps and hashmaps.
// A map can be implemented by using the Map class
const map = new Map();
map["first"] = "first";
// Creating a hashmap means obviously to treat the hashmap as a huge object while the keys are the attributes.
// In addition it is possible to provide a type for the key, if it is a string, number etc.
// Objects are not possible as an hash value
const hashMap = {};
hashMap["1"] = "1";
