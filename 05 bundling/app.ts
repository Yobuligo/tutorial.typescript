/**
 * TypeScript perhaps contains meaningful but long class, method, function or property names. Perhaps it contains additional comments or even documentation and of course many files.
 * This means when somebody uses the library especially for web application it requires several Rest calls to get get the code from the server to the client. 
 * And with comments and long, meaningful names the workload is bigger than required.
 * 
 * To shrink those data it is possible to create a bundle.js (or any other name). It contains the data in a compressed way. 
 * The names are shorted, documentation is removed and only the necessary stuff which is required for the browser is left. 
 * 
 * Here the tool webpack can be used.
